# CustomChat

This is addon for WoW that will print into your chat what you want (you can emulate GM/enemy fraction/colored texts/etc.)
It was created just as Proof Of Concept that screenshots of chat in WoW can be faked. So it is bad idea to allow bans based on screenshots.

It was created for WoW 30300, with support of Ace3 addons. 

You can use it in your game, or update it for newer version if you want to. (would be nice if you pull your changes in this repository too)
